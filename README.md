### Description

Tired of slow lyrics finding websites with all their popups? I was, until one night I decided to start a little something that turned into a big something. A very useful utility, this can retrive lyrics by artist or or both artist and song name for a quick find. You will see nothing from any lyrics website, this parses the pages from azlyrics.com and puts the lyrics into a rich textbox complete with html parsing (bold, italic, etc). Code is uncommented, yet there are barely any bugs that would bother anyone. If you like, vote - alot of work was put into this. Any improvements are welcome.
